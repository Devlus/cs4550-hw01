        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>As a User I would like to be able to post a meow (tweet) to my followers</h3>
                <div>

                    he wants into the box on his homepage, and hit the "Post" button to send it. Alternatively, if he would
                    like to write a long post, he can click the edit button on the left side of the input box to go to a
                    full markdown editor.

                    click the stalk right from the search page, or can click view to go the other persons page, and select
                    stalk from there.
